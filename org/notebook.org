** Announcement: Journal club!

Data science enthusiasts: there will be a "journal club" on Wednesday
12-12:45 pm in Derby room 209. We'll put the papers in a GDrive.

For the first journal club on Januar 31, I'd like to submit my last
non-technical paper, "The role of AI coding assistants: revisiting the
need for literate programming in computer and data science education."
([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OonJ1pesK2iRP3JDf4MoBRgg4NKk91yU/view?usp=sharing][Link]]) This paper will be presented at INTED'24, the 18th annual
International Technology, Education and Development Conference in
Valencia (Spain), March 4-6.

You can get some background on this topic from the wall poster in
front of my office, about the paper that I wrote before this one.
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 400px:
[[../img/MDPI_2023_BIRKENKRAHE_poster.pptx.png]]

*Caveat:* in a journal club, you discuss other people's papers and not
your own - I will try to simulate that by discussing my paper as if
someone else had written it, and also using AI to deliver a critique.

*** Pretty useless summary (ChatGPT/AiPDF)
The document titled "[[https://github.com/birkenkrahe/os24/blob/main/pdf/The_Linux_System.pdf][The Linux System]]" provides a comprehensive view
of the Linux operating system, particularly focusing on its use with
the Raspberry Pi. The key points covered in the document include:

- *Linux System Overview*: It starts by introducing essential operating
  system concepts like processes, users, files, permissions, and
  credentials. It discusses the chain of events in booting Linux on
  the Raspberry Pi, creating Linux kernel modules, and building a
  custom Linux kernel. The chapter serves as a roadmap for the rest of
  the book, offering background knowledge rather than a how-to guide.

- *Operating System Hierarchy*: It details the Linux kernel's role and
  the interfacing between the kernel and user space applications. The
  document discusses processes, user space and kernel space, and the
  'everything is a file' concept in Linux.

- *Users and Permissions*: The system's multi-user nature, process
  creation, and user permissions are explored. It discusses the root
  user, the concept of credentials, and privileges in Linux.

- *Booting Linux on Arm-Based Systems*: The document provides an
  in-depth look at the boot process of Linux on the Raspberry Pi,
  covering each stage in detail. It explains the roles of various
  components like =bootcode.bin=, =start.elf=, =kernel.img=, and the
  =initramfs= in the boot process.

- *System Initialization* and *Login Process*: The role of the =systemd=
  process in system initialization, the process of user login via
  terminal or graphical interface, and the involvement of =getty= and
  login programs are outlined.

- *Kernel Administration* and *Programming*: It covers topics like
  loadable kernel modules, device drivers, and the anatomy of a Linux
  kernel module. The document also guides on building custom kernel
  modules and the complete kernel.

- *Administrator and Programmer View*: The document then shifts focus to
  how these concepts are relevant to system administrators and
  programmers, covering process management, scheduling, memory
  management, concurrency, parallelism, I/O, and persistent storage.

- *Exercises and Questions*: The chapter concludes with exercises and
  questions on installing Raspbian, setting up =ssh=, writing kernel
  modules, understanding the Linux boot process, and system
  administration tasks.

  This summary provides an overview of the topics covered in the
  document, offering insights into the practical aspects of Linux
  system administration and programming, particularly in relation to
  the Raspberry Pi. For more detailed information, you can refer to
  the document: [[[https://myaidrive.com/792tCDLz4VFrqZy2/The_Linux_Sy.pdf][The Linux System]]].

** Practice: first use of the shell on Raspberry Pi

- When you are on the X11 graphical desktop and you start the
  terminal, you're actually using a terminal emulator.

- Open the terminal outside of Emacs now, and try a few
  commands:
  1) find out who you are:
     #+begin_src sh
       whoami
     #+end_src
  2) find out where your computer is on the network:
     #+begin_src sh
       hostname -I
     #+end_src
  3) show the date and time:
     #+begin_src sh
       date
     #+end_src
  4) show available disk space in a format suitable for
     humans (only show the first five lines):
     #+begin_src sh
       df -H | head -n 5
     #+end_src
  5) show the amount of free memory:
     #+begin_src sh
       free
     #+end_src
  6) see all running process (refreshed every 5 seconds):
     #+begin_src sh
       top
     #+end_src

** Opportunity: working with a [social] entrepreneurship project
#+ATTR_HTML: :WIDTH 400px:
[[../img/social.webp]]

If you're interested in making the world a better place not just in a
general, but in a specific way, starting right here in Batesville, and
earn extra credit, you can use your project in connection with the
"social entrepreneurship club" (SEC) - to reduce poverty, ignorance,
and even hunger. For Operating Systems, this will take a little more
thought than e.g. for databases.

One example might be the creation of a maker space for kids, or of a
series of realistic Raspberry Pi projects. To brainstorm ideas and see
what is already cooking, get together with Dr. Peter Staples and me,
and/or join the Google Space for SEC.

Dr. Staples will also offer a project management course this summer.

** Project challenge - (virtually) impossible


- 420 level course = independence and inspiration!
- This is a great opportunity for AI to shine!
- We'll only have 3 sprints, after 6, 11 and 15 weeks:
  1. Proposal in week 6.
  2. Results in week 11.
  3. Final presentation in week 16.

#+begin_quote
Prompt: "Give me 15 project ideas for a course on Operating Systems,
especially Linux. A project is completed by an individual student. The
project runs for 15 weeks. The student must produce a proposal
including methodology and references."
#+end_quote

[[https://chat.openai.com/share/c278de95-6b4a-4588-acb3-146689054b4d][Here's the answer.]] Including a sample breakdown of one project, and
the prerequisites:

1) Student with knowledge and experience
   - Computer Architecture
   - C programming (especially pointers, memory management)
   - Command line, bash programming, GCC, GNU make
2) Beginner
   - Set up a Linux environment (virtual machine) for experimentation
   - Write a simple kernel module
   - Compile the module
   - Learn to load and unload the kernel module
   - View kernel log for module output.

How such a kernel module could look like:
#+begin_example C
#include <linux/module.h>   // Needed for all modules
#include <linux/kernel.h>   // Needed for KERN_INFO

// Module Initialization function
static int __init simple_module_init(void) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "SimpleModule: Module loaded!\n");
    return 0; // Return 0 means module successfully loaded
}

// Module Cleanup function
static void __exit simple_module_exit(void) {
    printk(KERN_INFO "SimpleModule: Module unloaded!\n");
}

// Register module entry and exit points
module_init(simple_module_init);
module_exit(simple_module_exit);

// Module information
MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Your Name");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("A Simple Linux Kernel Module");
MODULE_VERSION("0.1");
#+end_example

Simpler: bash- and shell-related projects.
** Project challenge - (totally) possible

Re-create a Raspberry Pi projects. The choice is yours!

- [[https://pimylifeup.com/category/projects/][List of 160+ projects]]
- [[https://www.hackster.io/raspberry-pi/projects][4343 Raspberry Pi Projects]]

To do this, and to do stuff at home, you can take your Pi home if you
like and if you promise to look after it. If you destroy it, you'll
have to replace it - the Pi400 only costs $84 right now [[https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-400-Computer-Kit-RPI400-US/dp/B08MYVQW1S/ref=sr_1_2?crid=7VCXPFUD7I0R&keywords=pi400&qid=1705606222&s=books&sprefix=pi400%2Cstripbooks%2C122&sr=1-2&ufe=app_do%3Aamzn1.fos.006c50ae-5d4c-4777-9bc0-4513d670b6bc][at
Amazon]]. (You might want to get your own anyway!)

You may have to purchase some equipment (I have a limited private
supply only). But it shouldn't break the bank especially since you
didn't have to buy a textbook (e.g. Intel NeuralStick 60$, LCD HAT
$20, )

Featured sample project for beginners:
- [[https://www.hackster.io/sridhar-rajagopal/international-space-station-tracker-6afdca][International Space Station tracker]] (2020) + Python

** Project challenge - conceptual projects

Any topic related to operating systems, even if we talked about it in
class: deepen it and make it interactive (for others) if you can. You
could take a chapter from any of the textbooks mentioned in the
syllabus, research and present it.

A project could also be the use of Linux in an area of your interest,
for example finance, video games, scientific supercomputing, particle
experiments, cosmology, or sports analytics.

You can also pick Windows or MacOS as a topic, and contrast it with
Linux. We've talked about this in class, but only anecdotally and
sporadically.

It would be good If you can link this project with the project in
another class you take with me this term - that way you can go deeper
and spend more time on one topic. Talk to me if you wish to do this.

1) Where's the "firmware" and what does it do?
   #+begin_notes
   - What: Manufacturer-specific software that provides low-level
     control for a device's specific hardware.
   - Where: embedded in the non-volatile ROM (Read-Only-Memory)
   #+end_notes
2) What's the short definition of an OS?
   #+begin_notes
   An OS is a resource allocator - for processing time (CPU) and
   memory (RAM).
   #+end_notes
3) Is the OS "fair"?
   #+begin_notes
   The OS strives to schedule processes to get equal share of the CPU
   but in the interest of system integrity, process and user priority,
   it must routinely play favorites.

4) Does the OS respond to every user request?
   #+begin_notes
   No though every request will get a hearing as long as it reaches
   the shell. While the OS aims to manage resources efficiently and
   provide application program services, requests may be denied due
   to:
   - insufficient permissions
   - resource limitations
   - system policies
   - system request errors
   #+end_notes
5) How is a device controlled by the OS?
   #+begin_notes
   1. Device driver loads registers in the device controller.
   2. Device controller decides which action to take, like 'read
      character' from keyboard.
   3. Controller transfers data from device to its local buffer.
   4. When transfer is complete, device driver is informed via an
      *interrupt* signal from the controller.
   #+end_notes
6) What are "system interrupts"?
   #+begin_notes
   An interrupt is a signal to the CPU from hardware or software
   indicating an event that needs the CPUs immediate attention. All
   current operations are halted, the current state is saved, and
   execution is transferred to the interrupt handler to address the
   event. An example: printer job is finished.
   #+end_notes
7) Which program runs at all times (while the computer is on)?
   #+begin_notes
   The OS kernel, or the managing brain of the CPU operation.
   #+end_notes
8) Which daemon runs at all times (while the computer is on)?
   #+begin_notes
   The system daemon program or =systemd=.
   #+end_notes
9) What is "multiprogramming"?
   #+begin_notes
   Aka "Batch system" operation mode:
   - Jobs (code + data) are organized to keep the CPU always busy.
   - One job is selected and run via job scheduling.
   - Jobs may have to wait (e.g. for I/O) and the OS switches to another.
   #+end_notes
10) What is "timesharing"?
    #+begin_notes
    Aka "multitasking":
    - CPU switches jobs so fast that users get the illusion of
      interactive computing
    - Timesharing gives rise to the different OS management tasks:
      1. Memory management (e.g. assign and use local variables)
      2. Process management (e.g. using the CPU)
      3. Scheduling management (e.g. switching processes)
      4. Device management (e.g. find and use printer)
      5. File management (e.g. find and use files)

** DataCamp `shell` review - Where are we? What do you know?
*** You know how to create, change, copy, remove, link files and directories:

| COMMAND | MEANING                   | EXAMPLE            | EXAMPLE          |
|---------+---------------------------+--------------------+------------------|
| cd      | change directory          | cd ..              | cd /home/marcus  |
| pwd     | present working directory | pwd                |                  |
| mkdir   | make directory            | mkdir              | mkdir -v         |
| echo    | show text or variables    | echo "hello"       | echo $HOME       |
| mv      | move file or directory    | mv a b             | mv a ../b        |
| cp      | copy file or directory    | cp a b             | cp a ../b        |
| rm      | remove file               | rm file            | rm -rf dir       |
| ln      | create soft or hard link  | ln -s file symfile | ln -l file file1 |

*** You know how to view data sets whole, and in parts by rows and columns:

| COMMAND | MEANING                | EXAMPLE       | COMMENT                |
|---------+------------------------+---------------+------------------------|
| cat     | view                   | cat file      |                        |
| less    | view page-wise         | less file     | q to quit              |
| head    | view top rows/bytes    | head -n 5     | top five rows          |
| tail    | view bottom rows/bytes | tail -c 3     | bottom 3 bytes         |
| ls      | list dir files         | ls -RaF .     | list pwd recursively   |
|         |                        |               | w/hidden files & flag  |
| cut     | view column values     | cut -f 2 file | extract 2nd column     |
| history | command history        | !100 or !head | repeat command no. 100 |
|         |                        |               | or last run of `head`  |
| grep    | match lines by pattern | grep -chilvn  |                        |

- Cutting columns in the presence of quotation marks: what if we want
  to extract only the last names, or only the age?
  #+begin_src bash
    # view the file
    cat ../data/everyone.csv; echo -----

    # cut doesn't cut it in this case
    cut -f 2 -d , ../data/everyone.csv; echo -----

    # ignore the header, extract 2nd column, lose trailing quotation marks
    tail -n +2 ../data/everyone.csv | awk -F, '{print $2}'| tr -d '"'; echo -----

    # same thing for the 3rd column (no need to remove quotation marks)
    tail -n +2 ../data/everyone.csv | awk -F, '{print $3}'
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  #+begin_example
  Name,Age
  "Johel,Ranjit",28
  "Sharma,Rupinder",26
  -----
  Age
  Ranjit"
  Rupinder"
  -----
  Ranjit
  Rupinder
  -----
  28
  26
  #+end_example

*** You know how to combine commands with pipes and simple redirection

| COMMAND | MEANING                   | EXAMPLE   | COMMENT               |
|---------+---------------------------+-----------+-----------------------|
| sort    | sort input                | sort -nr  | numerical / reverse   |
| uniq    | remove duplicate lines    | uniq -ci  | count/ignore case     |
| wc      | word/character/line count | wc        | counts all w/c/l      |
| >       | redirect stdin            | ls > file | store listing in file |

- What does this command do?
  #+begin_src bash :results output
  ls | sort -r | wc -l
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:
  : 12

  #+begin_quote
  Answer:
  1. lists all files by name only
  2. sorts them in reverse alphabetical order
  3. counts the number of lines = number of files in pwd

  Notice that the effects of the ~sort~ program do not show at all -
  it's superfluous (though it's not in the way).
