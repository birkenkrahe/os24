** Announcement: Journal club!

Data science enthusiasts: there will be a "journal club" on Wednesday
12-12:45 pm in Derby room 209. We'll put the papers in a GDrive.

For the first journal club on Januar 31, I'd like to submit my last
non-technical paper, "The role of AI coding assistants: revisiting the
need for literate programming in computer and data science education."
([[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OonJ1pesK2iRP3JDf4MoBRgg4NKk91yU/view?usp=sharing][Link]]) This paper will be presented at INTED'24, the 18th annual
International Technology, Education and Development Conference in
Valencia (Spain), March 4-6.

You can get some background on this topic from the wall poster in
front of my office, about the paper that I wrote before this one.

*Caveat:* in a journal club, you discuss other people's papers and not
your own - I will try to simulate that by discussing my paper as if
someone else had written it, and also using AI to deliver a critique.
