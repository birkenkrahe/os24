* Exercise: Manipulate Files and Data in Linux using Emacs Org-mode
  - **Objective**: Utilize Emacs Org-mode to practice file manipulation
    commands in a Linux environment, reinforcing your understanding
    through hands-on experience.
  - **Duration**: 30 minutes
  - **Tools Required**: Access to a Linux terminal, Emacs installed,
    preferably on a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian GNU/Linux 11
    (bullseye) as per the initial setup in the lecture.

* Instructions:
  - You are required to document all your commands and observations in
    an Emacs Org-mode file. This Org-mode file will be submitted upon
    completion of the exercise.
  - Open Emacs and create a new Org-mode file named
    `Feb_22_Practice.org`.

* Part 1: Setup (5 minutes)
  - In your Org-mode file, document the process of checking your
    current directory with `pwd` and navigating to your home directory
    using `cd $HOME`.
  - Create a directory named `exercise_playground` and note the
    command used in your Org-mode file.
  - Navigate into `exercise_playground` and record this in your
    Org-mode document.

* Part 2: Directory and File Manipulation (15 minutes)
  - **Task 1**: Create two directories within `exercise_playground`,
    named `exercise_dir1` and `exercise_dir2`. Document the commands
    in your Org-mode file.
  - **Task 2**: Copy the `/etc/passwd` file to your current directory,
    rename it to `passwd_copy`, and note each step in your Org-mode
    file.
  - **Task 3**: Move `passwd_copy` into `exercise_dir1`, create a hard
    link in `exercise_dir2` named `passwd_hardlink`, and a symbolic
    link in `exercise_playground` pointing to `passwd_copy` inside
    `exercise_dir1`, named `passwd_symlink`. Document these steps.
  - **Task 4**: Use `ls -l` to verify the location and existence of the
    files and links, and document the output.

* Part 3: Clean-up and Verification (10 minutes)
  - **Task 1**: Delete `passwd_hardlink` and move `passwd_copy` back to
    `exercise_playground`. Remove both `exercise_dir1` and
    `exercise_dir2`. Document each command and its output.
  - **Task 2**: Confirm your directory structure with `ls -l` and ensure
    all actions were completed as intended.
  - **Final Step**: Document the process of removing
    `exercise_playground` to clean up your workspace.

* Submission Instructions:
  - Ensure all your commands, their outputs, and any observations are
    clearly documented in your Org-mode file.
  - Save your Org-mode file and submit it to Canvas for
    grading. Include any reflections on the process, challenges
    encountered, and how you addressed them.

* Reflection:
  - Reflect on the usage of Emacs Org-mode for documenting
    command-line operations. How does this approach benefit learning
    and documentation practices? How does it challenge you?
