* Terminal emulators

- When you are on the X11 graphical desktop and you start the
  terminal, you're actually using a terminal emulator.

- Open the terminal outside of Emacs now, and try a few
  commands:
  1) find out who you are:
     #+begin_src sh
       whoami
     #+end_src
  2) find out where your computer is on the network:
     #+begin_src sh
       hostname -I
     #+end_src
  3) show the date and time:
     #+begin_src sh
       date
     #+end_src
  4) show available disk space in a format suitable for
     humans (only show the first five lines):
     #+begin_src sh
      df -H | head -n 5
     #+end_src
  5) show the amount of free memory:
     #+begin_src sh
       free
     #+end_src
  6) see all running process (refreshed every 5 seconds):
     #+begin_src sh
       top
     #+end_src

- There are three terminal programs available in Emacs, too:
  1) the regular shell (open with ~M-x shell~). Exit it with =exit=.

  2) the =eshell=, which is a shell emulator written in Emacs Lisp (open
     with ~M-x eshell~). Exit it with =exit=.

  3) the terminal, which is a proper terminal inside Emacs (open with
     ~M-x term RET~). Exit it by killing the current buffer (~C-x k~).

- Try some of the earlier commands in each of these shells.

- On the shell, ~M-n/p~ moves around the command history buffer.
