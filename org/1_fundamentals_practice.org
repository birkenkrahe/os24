1) Put your name at the top on the =#+author= line and write "pledged"
   next to it.

2) There are three terminal programs available in Emacs, too - open them:
   1. the regular shell (open with ~M-x shell~). Exit it with =exit=.
   2. the =eshell=, which is a shell emulator written in Emacs Lisp (open
      with ~M-x eshell~). Exit it with =exit=.
   3. the terminal, which is a proper terminal inside Emacs (open with
      ~M-x term RET~). Exit it by killing the current buffer (~C-x k~).

3) Try some of the earlier commands in each of these shells:
   - find out who you are 
   - find out where your computer is on the network
   - show date and time 
   - show available disk space in human-readable format 
   - show amount of free memory
   - see all running processes

4) Remember (and try it): the shell, ~M-n/p~ moves around the command
   history buffer.
   
5) Below, create a new code block with ~<s TAB~ for each task and add
   the header argument ~sh~

6) Find out who you are:

7) find out where your computer is on the network:

8) show the date and time:

9) show available disk space in a format suitable for humans (only
   show the first five lines):

10) show the amount of free memory:

11) see all running process (refreshed every 5 seconds):
