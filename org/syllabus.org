* Standard and course policies

*Standard Lyon College Policies* are incorporated into this syllabus
and can be found at: [[http://www.lyon.edu/standard-course-policies][lyon.edu/standard-course-policies]].

The *Assignments and Honor Code* and the *Attendance Policy* are
incorporated into this syllabus also and can be found at:

* Objectives

Operating systems manage a computer’s resources for its users and
their applications. We focus on the underlying concepts, look at
examples and try them out - my preferred sandbox being Linux, which
you will be introduced to, including process management and simple
shell programming. We also address concurrency and parallelization,
cloud computing, memory, and storage management. In lab sessions,
we use the Raspberry Pi as a platform to try stuff and get much
closer to the machine than PC OS like Windows or MacOS allow. The
lessons will directly lead to you feeling calm and powerful when
working on your computer. A worthwhile investment! We will cover
chapters from Silberschatz (2018), a standard text on OS concepts,
and from Shotts (2019), a complete introduction to the Linux OS.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete CSC 420 "Operating Systems (OS)", will be
able to:

- Understand how operating systems manage concurrent processes
- Know OS design principles and implementation strategies
- Know how to configure and run a Raspberry Pi-based Linux box
- Use the command line interface and UNIX-style shell (~bash~)
- Learn how to write simple shell scripts
- Know how to process data with the shell
- Know how to effectively present assignment results
- Know principles and practice of virtualization

* Course requirements

Some knowledge of, and experience with computers is useful but not
critical: we will start from basic concepts. Curiosity and personal
discipline are essential. You will gain data literacy skills by
taking this course. The course will prepare you for further studies
in computer and data science, or in other disciplines that use
modern computing, i.e. every discipline, from accounting to
zoology).

For a deeper understanding of the concepts, familiarity with basic
data structures, computer architecture, and a high-level language,
such as C or Java, is useful.

Formal prerequisites according to the Lyon College 2023/24 catalog:
CSC 265 (algorithms).

* Grading table

This table is used to convert completion rates into letter grades. for
the midterm results, letter grades still carry signs, while for the
term results, only straight letters are given (by rounding up). This
table is also used in Canvas to compute your grades. Transitions
between letter grades are rounded (e.g. 89.5% to 90%).

|------------------+------------------|
| Percentage       | LETTER GRADE*    |
|------------------+------------------|
| 100% to 89.5%    | A (very good)    |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 89.5% to 79.5% | B (good)         |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 79.5% to 69.5% | C (satisfactory) |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 69.5% to 59.5% | D (passed)       |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 59.5% to 0%    | F (FAILED)       |
|------------------+------------------|

* Grading system

| WHAT                    | WEIGHT |
|-------------------------+--------|
| Assignments             |    25% |
| Final Project           |    25% |
| Weekly tests            |    25% |
| Final exam (optional)   |    25% |

Notes:
- To pass: 60% of all available points.
- Assignments include
- Tests: weekly online quizzes, which are previewed and reviewed in
  class.
- Final exam: selection of the most challenging weekly quiz questions.
- You only have to write the final exam if you want to improve your
  grade at the end of the course. If the final exam result is below
  your final grade average up to this point, it will be ignored.
- There will be numerous (optional) bonus assignments to improve your
  midterm and final grades.

*DataCamp*:
- [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-shell][Introduction to Shell]]: The Unix command line has survived and
  thrived for almost 50 years because it lets people do complex things
  with just a few keystrokes. Sometimes called "the universal glue of
  programming," it helps users combine existing programs in new ways,
  automate repetitive tasks, and run programs on clusters and clouds
  that may be halfway around the world. This course will introduce its
  key elements and show you how to use them efficiently.
- [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/introduction-to-bash-scripting][Introduction to Bash Scripting]]: Bash is a concise, superfast, and
  robust scripting language for data and file manipulation. It’s a
  vital skill for building analytics pipelines in the cloud, favored
  by Linux users to work with data stored across multiple files. In
  this course, we’ll guide you through the basics of Bash
  scripting. We begin with an introduction to Bash script structures,
  including inputting arguments and outputting results. You’ll then
  work through data structures, such as variables and arrays, and
  control statements, including loops and conditionals. You’ll then
  put what you’ve learned into practice, by creating your own Bash
  functions and scheduling automated scripts to run like clockwork
  with cron.
- [[https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-processing-in-shell][Data processing in Shell]]: We live in a busy world with tight
  deadlines.  As a result, we fall back on what is familiar and easy,
  favoring GUI interfaces like Anaconda and RStudio. However, taking
  the time to learn data analysis on the command line is a great
  long-term investment because it makes us stronger and more
  productive data people. In this course, we will take a practical
  approach to learn simple, powerful, and data-specific command-line
  skills.  Using publicly available Spotify datasets, we will learn
  how to download, process, clean, and transform data, all via the
  command line.  We will also learn advanced techniques such as
  command-line based SQL database operations.  Finally, we will
  combine the powers of command line and Python to build a data
  pipeline for automating a predictive model.

*Workload:* approx. 4-5 hours per week.
1. Class time = 16 * 3 * 50/60 = 40 hours
2. Tests (home) = 16 * .5 = 8 hours
3. DataCamp assignments: 13 * 2 = 26 hrs (approx.)
